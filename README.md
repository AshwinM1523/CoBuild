CoBuild is a web application 





CoBuild is a full-fledged job board web application designed to enhance the job application process by providing a unique approach to candidate assessment. By leveraging the power of LeetCode questions and job posting descriptions, CoBuild enables users to solve coding problems directly related to specific job postings. This allows candidates to gauge their skills and compare their performance against other applicants, gaining valuable insights and boosting their chances of success.
Motivation

The motivation behind CoBuild stems from the recognition of the challenges faced by job seekers in the competitive employment landscape. Traditional job boards often lack interactivity and fail to provide meaningful feedback on candidates' technical skills. CoBuild aims to bridge this gap by combining the familiarity of job postings with the rigor of LeetCode-style coding challenges. This unique approach helps candidates better understand the requirements of potential employers and empowers them to improve their skills accordingly.
